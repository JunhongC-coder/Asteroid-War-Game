More vitally, we also tend to enhance the maintainability, usability, \textcolor{red}{robustness} and help users get a better control by enhancing the functionality and implementation of this project. 
\subsection{What is the context of the problem you are solving?}
Asteroids is a well-known game in the past several years. The original Asteroids game is a single-player web-based game, within a poor \textcolor{red}{user} interface and difficult controls. However, it should be improved to be \sout{suitable} \textcolor{red}{available} for one player or two players. The \sout{audience} \textcolor{red}{users} of Asteroids is people of different ages. Asteroids will be run in a web-based environment and it may be played \sout{with presses of} \textcolor{red}{by using} a keyboard. In addition, score counters should be added into the game to show the score that the players attain during \textcolor{red}{and after} this game .
