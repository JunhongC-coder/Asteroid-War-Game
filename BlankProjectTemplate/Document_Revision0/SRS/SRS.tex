This document describes the requirements for Asteroid Game Development. The template for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicity state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The goal of this project is to improve the user interface, functionality, and implementation of the old Asteroid Game. Improving the user interface of the original game can significantly enhance the user experience because the players will be able to play this game with better qualities. More importantly, this project also aims to improve the functionality and implementation by reproducing a two players mode and a rank system which provides a method for users to evaluate their game performance with others.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
The stakeholders include the clients, customers, other stakeholders. 
\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients are the professors, teaching assistants of Software Engineering 3XA3 who are responsible to supervise the project and keep track of the project process. 
\subsubsection{The Customers}
The intended customers are the public people who have an intermediate understanding of the English language, interests in Asteroid, and the ability to use a computer device, mouse, keyboard, and web browser. 
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Indirect Stakeholder: The indirect Stakeholders are all developers in team 3XA3 Lab3 Group12 who are responsible to develop, modify, maintain the Asteroid Game, and achieve all targets and requirements in SRS.  
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Time Constraint}
The entire project must be completed and submitted by April 12th, 2021. 
\subsubsection{Cost Constraint}
There is no cost for this project because the required software and open-resource codes are free to use. 
\subsubsection{Product Constraint}
This product requires users to have the access to an efficient internet connection and a web browser with a computer, keyboard, and mouse.
\subsubsection{Knowledge Constraint}
The users must have an intermediate understanding of the English language and the basic knowledge to browser a website.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsubsection{JavaScript}
A high-level, object-oriented computer programming language conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is commonly used to create interactive effects in a web browser. 

\subsubsection{HTML}
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

\subsubsection{CSS}
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 

\subsubsection{Node.js}
an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. 

\subsubsection{JSON}
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open file and data interchange format to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types.  


\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

Asteroids will assume that the intended users must at least maintain an intermediate understanding of the English language and the ability to browse a website with using a computer, keyboard, and mouse. However, this application will not require the users to have any other technical background or education because a user manual will be provided on the main page of Asteroids.  

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
Asteroids is a browser game in which the user can control a spaceship and shoot asteroids while avoiding getting hit by them. The context of the work is to rebuild and modify Asteroids, including editing the existing code for better readability and maintainability, improving the interface of the game by adding some colors and images, adding some advanced features like score counting,difficulty level selection, leaderboard and two-player mode.\\

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}1.]
    \item The users must be able to access the website and play the game.\\
        Fit Criterion:  The user will be able to access the game by inputting the link to the web browser and clicking the start button to start the game.
        \item Scores should be shown on the screen to the users during the game. \\
        Fit Criterion: The game will display the scores that the player gains when playing the game.
		
		\item When the spaceship is hit by an asteroid, the lives of the spaceship will be reduced by 1.\\
        Fit Criterion: The lives of spaceships will be reduced by 1 when collision of it and an asteroid occurs.
        
        \item When the lives of the spaceship is zero, the game will be over and the result will be shown.\\
        Fit Criterion: The game will generate a result message and display the scores after the player loses three lives.
       
        \item The game will generate a battlefield for the player.\\
         Fit Criterion: The website interface will generate a battlefield that allows the user to control the spaceship to fly around in a limited size.

        \item The game will generate a spaceship for the player.\\
         Fit Criterion: The website interface will generate a spaceship that allows the user to control by arrow keys three lives and is able to shoot the asteroid to destroy them by pressing space.

        \item The main page of Asteroid will include a user manual for the player.\\
	Fit Criterion: The users could view the instructions and controls of the game by viewing the user manual.

The old game was initially implemented as a black and white rough interface. Our group will redesign the user interface and add some new features to the game so as to enhance the performance and quality of the game. 


\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Existing Products}
There are many existing products for that have created the game of Asteroid, They are listed below:\\
Asteroid online game:\\
\url{http://www.dougmcinnes.com/html-5-asteroids}\\
Asteroid online scoreboard:\\
\url{https://games.aarp.org/games/atari-asteroids}\\
Improved classic Asteroid  game - webstore:\\
\url{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asteroids-classical-aster/pdjmcidindccobjfklphgnefglooeidl}\\


For this project, there are a lot of examples on the website, to create a better version of Asteroid, one of the important steps is to investigate these existing solutions, analyzing the advantages and drawbacks and improve the implementations and meet the project requirements.


\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Problems in System}
The project must be run on a web browser. The game will be interrupted and stop running if the system server crashes or the internet connection is lost. 
\subsubsection{Problems in Compiling Environment}
The game interface must be compatible with diverse devices and browsers which the users can play this game on different sizes of screen.
